## WORKSHOP ON STARTER PACKAGES FOR COMPUTATIONAL CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS RESEARCH [Wannier90]

This repository contains a tutorial presented at the Workshop on Starter Packages for Computational Condensed Matter Physics Research using Wannier90, a collaboration between the Research Center for Quantum Physics BRIN and FMIPA UNHAS.

There are two folders available: Graphene and 1T'-MoS2. Each tutorial aims to generate a Wannier interpolation and tight-binding parameter, followed by the construction of a tight-binding model using the pythtb package. For the 1T'-MoS2 tutorial, there is an additional tutorial demonstrating the calculation of edge states at the (100) surface with 20 slabs.
